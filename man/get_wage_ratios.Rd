\description{

the hourly wage distribution. The larger the ratio, the greater the gap between the
top and the middle or the middle and the bottom of the wage distribution.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item{A 50–10 wage ratio of 1.91 means that workers at the 50th percentile of the wage
      distribution are paid 1.91 times more per hour than the workers at the 10th percentile.}
\item{A 95–50 wage ratio of 3.28 means that workers at the 95th percentile of the wage
      distribution are paid 3.28 times more per hour than the workers at the 50th percentile.}
