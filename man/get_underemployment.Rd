Underemployment is the share of the labor force that either 1) is unemployed, 2) is
working part time but wants and is available to work full time (an "involuntary" part
timer), or 3) wants and is available to work and has looked for work in the last year
but has given up actively seeking work in the last four weeks ("marginally attached"
worker).
