Tools to Retrieve Economic Policy Institute Data Library Extracts

## Description 

The [Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/data/) provides researchers, media, and the public with easily accessible, up-to-date, and comprehensive historical data on the American labor force. It is compiled from Economic Policy Institute analysis of government data sources. Use it to research wages, inequality, and other economic indicators over time and among demographic groups. Data is usually updated monthly.

- `get_black_white_wage_gap`:	Retreive the percent by which hourly wages of black workers are less than hourly wages of white workers
- `get_college_wage_premium`:	Retreive the percent by which hourly wages of college graduates exceed those of otherwise equivalent high school graduates
- `get_compensation_wages_and_benefits`:	Compensation, wages, and benefits
- `get_employment_to_population_ratio`:	Retreive the share of the civilian noninstitutional population that is employed

- `get_labor_force_participation_rate`:	Retreive the share of the civilian noninstitutional population that is in the labor force
- `get_long_term_unemployment`:	Retreive the share of the labor force that has been unemployed for six months or longer
- `get_median_and_mean_wages`:	Retreive the hourly wage in the middle of the wage distribution
- `get_minimum_wage`:	Minimum wage
- `get_non_high_school_wage_penalty`:	Retreive the percent by which hourly wages of workers without a high school diploma (or equivalent) are less than wages of otherwise equivalent workers who have graduated from high school
